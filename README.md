# led_numbers
Collection of LED_Numbers app written in different programming languages (49 so far).

Basically when you input a number like 1977 the output will be like this...

```
   _  _  _
| |_|  |  |
|   |  |  |
```

Keep in mind that everytime I learn a new programming language, I code this application...so that means that obviously I'm not going to use the best practices or it's going to be most performance ready app...

I build this as a newbie...and for newbies...I want to help promote language not to scare people away from them...

Having a 20 lines code in 3 lines it's cool...but might be too complicate and scary for someone how has never approached the code before...

I'm sure a lot of people are going to send me "Corrections" or "Better ways to use the language capabilities" but...I'm not planning to implement any of those...these are coded in that way and I believe they serve a purpose...this are not "Open Source" applications...but snippets to show newcomers how some weird and obscure programming languages look like...

Blag.
